# Data Structures

In this repository, I am going to collect all the materials from my current [course](https://sites.google.com/cs.stonybrook.edu/cse214/) Data Structures which is being taught by professor Ritwik Banerjee  at Stony Brook University

***

(*Course description from the course website)

#### Course Outcomes: 

- An ability to program using sophisticated features of object-oriented programming.

- An ability to define and use data types, and use data structures.

- An understanding of the importance of time and memory efficiency in algorithm design.

### Course Topics: 

#### Software Design: 

- Specifications; memory and execution time efficiency; introduction to Big Oh notation; abstract data types and examples; review of object-oriented techniques.

#### Linked Lists: 

- Singly-linked lists; implementation; inserting and removing data; variations: doubly-linked lists, circular linked lists; comparison of arrays and linked lists.

#### Stacks and Queues:

- Basic stack operations; implementation using an array and a linked list; various stack applications (evaluating prefix, post-fix, and infix, conversions between them, etc.).

- Basic queue operations; implementation using an array and a linked list; queue applications.

#### Recursion: 

- Activation records, backtracking, introduction to dynamic programming, tail recursion.

#### Binary Trees: 

- Terminology; implementation of trees using nodes; binary search trees: insertion and removal of data; tree traversals.

#### Heaps:

- Implementation using arrays; use of a heap as a priority queue.

#### Balanced Trees: 

- B-trees; 2-3-trees; 2-3-4-trees; red-black trees; AVL trees; splay trees; examples.

#### Searching: 

- Search algorithms; hashing and hash tables; time analysis.

#### Sorting: 

- Sorting algorithms; divide and conquer sorts, time analysis.

#### Introduction to Graphs: 

- Terminology; implementations using arrays and linked nodes; graph traversals (breadth-first and depth-first search).
